Week 2 - COVID-19 Global Analysis â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Hi! This is Syed Zayaan Ali from B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology. This is my Week 2 Data Science Project on Covid_19_Analysis as part of my internship at NSP Nexus
Project Title:
Exploratory Data Analysis on COVID-19 Global Dataset
Objective:
The aim of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global COVID-19 dataset. The goal is to understand the virus's spread across countries and over time, analyze date, country, confirmed, recovered, and death counts, and identify the most affected regions. Additionally, this project helped enhance my data cleaning and visualization skills using Python.

Steps I Followed:

1. Dataset Loading
â€¢	The dataset used was a public COVID-19 time series dataset including columns like: Date, Country/Region, Province/State, Confirmed, Deaths, and Recovered.
2. Imported Libraries
â€¢	Used essential Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
3. Data Inspection
â€¢	Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and explored the top rows.
â€¢	Performed .info() and .describe() to understand data structure and summary statistics.
4. Data Cleaning
â€¢	Checked for missing values and handled nulls (especially in Province/State).
â€¢	Verified data types and confirmed there were no duplicate records.
5. Analysis Highlights
â€¢	Counted unique values of dates and countries.
â€¢	Grouped data by Country/Region to calculate total confirmed cases.
â€¢	Identified top 10 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases.

Data Visualization:

To bring the analysis to life, I created several visualizations:
â€¢	Line Chart:
Showed the global trend of confirmed cases over time.
â€¢	Bar Chart:
Highlighted the Top 10 countries with the highest death counts.
â€¢	Pie Chart:
Illustrated the proportion between total recovered cases and deaths globally.
 
Key Insights & Observations:

â€¢	Over 187 countries were included in the dataset.
â€¢	Top 5 most affected countries (by confirmed cases):
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA, ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil, ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Russia, ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India, ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain
â€¢	The spread showed a consistent upward trend across several months.
â€¢	Some countries maintained disproportionately high death counts.
â€¢	Null values were primarily in Province/State but did not affect core analysis.

Conclusion:

This project gave me hands-on experience with real-world COVID-19 data. I improved my ability to:
â€¢	Clean and manipulate large datasets,
â€¢	Extract meaningful insights using group-based analysis,
â€¢	Build visualizations that convey trends clearly.
It reinforced how powerful Python is when it comes to understanding real-world problems through data.
